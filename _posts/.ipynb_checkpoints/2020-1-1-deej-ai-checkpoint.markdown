### Motivation

There are a number of automatic DJ tools around, which cleverly match the tempo of one song with another and mix the beats. To be honest, I have always found that kind of DJ rather boring: the better they are technically, the more it sounds just like one interminable song. In my book, it's not about how you play, but what you play. I have collected many rare records over the years and done a bit of deejaying on the radio and in clubs. I can almost instantly tell whether I am going to like a song or not just by listening to it for a few seconds. Or, if a song is playing, one that would go well with it usually comes to mind immediately. I thought that artificial intelligence could be applied to this "music intuition" as a music recommendation system based on simply listening to a song (and, of course, having an encyclopaedic knowledge of music).

Some years ago, the iPod had a very cool feature called Genius, which created a playlist on-the-fly based on a few example songs. Apple decided to remove this functionality (although it is still available in iTunes), presumably in a move to persuade people to subscribe to their music streaming service. Of course, Spotify now offers this functionality but, personally, I find the recommendations that it makes to be, at best, music I already know and, at worst, rather commercial and uncreative. I have a large library of music and I miss having a simple way to say "keep playing songs like this" (especially when I am driving) and something to help me discover new music, even within my own collection. I spent some time looking for an alternative solution but didn't find anything.
